problem statement:
Many startups in Kenya continue to struggle with securing sufficient capital beyond their initial funding and incubation stages due to Ineffective Information Presentation and Inefficient Communication Channels which is crucial for connecting with investors. The absence of a centralized system where startups can post their business projections, plans, and essential documentation hampers their ability to attract investment. Additionally, investors often face challenges in conducting thorough due diligence on the data provided by these businesses, leading to prolonged investment processes and increased uncertainty. This lack of streamlined communication and transparency not only deters potential funding but also inhibits the overall growth of the startup ecosystem in Kenya.

Target market: startup/impact business is a newly established business, typically in the early stages of development,that aims to create a unique product or service to meet a specific market demand.
